It operates in Retail, MSME and Corporate banking sectors. It offers wide range of differentiated products for corporate and retail customers through retail banking and asset management services.\n",

        "Sinces 2018, it has been in the news because of the fraud case involving Rana Kapoor. Owing to this fact, it was interesting to see how that impacted the stock prices of the company and whether Time series models or any other predictive models can do justice to such situations. This dataset has monthly stock prices of the bank since its inception and includes closing, starting, highest, and lowest stock prices of every month.\n",

        "So \"***Machine Learning***\" is helping us to resolve the issue of all those companies and firms who want to gather some courage in order to survive in the market for a longer time. By predicting the price with the acquaintance of Machine Learning especially the linear Regression and other regressors, which helped firms and companies to sustain in the market. In this project the monthly Open,Close,Low and High prices of Yes Bank stock have helped to train the model on which learning occurred and then the respective prediction occurs.\n",

At first I uploaded  that data set in our colab and read the csv file given by almabetter team . Then I checked the shape and size of data and got to know that there are 185 rows and five columns(features) .Then I useed describe to get the statistical information about our data and here we got to knoiw that our data is not normally distributed.Then I started Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) to get some important insights from that.\n",
